### Notes
- Place unit tests alongside code modules following Android testing conventions
- Use JUnit5 for JVM tests unless Android constraints force JUnit4; Espresso for UI tests
- Run tests with `./gradlew test` and `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest`
- Gradle: AAB ABI splits (arm64-v8a), ProGuard/R8 rules for CT2/llama `.so`, minSdk=29, targetSdk=34
- CI: unit + instrumented tests on Firebase Test Lab matrix for Tier A/B devices
- Manifest: `android:allowBackup="false"`, network security config, battery optimization exemption flow
- Printer retry with backoff and user hint for A5 scaling; notification actions localized EN/HI
- Lock NDK version in Gradle; add ProGuard keep rules for JNI entry points
- Pin Bluetooth SCO behavior doc if future badge uses BT
- Add StrictMode network-on-main policy in debug to catch accidental I/O
- Pin Gradle and AGP versions; enable reproducible builds
- Sentry/Crashlytics PII scrub rules checked in and diff-tested
- Pin minifyEnabled true for release with -whyareyoukeeping checks to keep JNI
- Add "Print grayscale proof" thumbnail before sending to printer to avoid A5 scaling surprises
- Persist NS/AEC/AGC choice per-clinic (not per-device) for consistent pilots
- Boot/monotonic provenance: include boot_id + monotonic timestamps in audit to survive wall-clock jumps

- Print/Share blocked without recent user auth; clipboard scrubs verified
- All HTTP blocked; TLS with user CA fails; pinned hosts still pass

✅ **Testing Strategy:**
