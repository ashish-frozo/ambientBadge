# Documentation Validation Report

**Version Reviewed:** v1.0.0  
**Review Date:** 2024-12-12  
**Reviewers:** Tech Writing Guild, QA Leads

## Scope
This review confirms that end-user, engineering, and compliance documentation accurately reflects the Ambient Scribe implementation as of commit `HEAD`.

## Methodology
1. Cross-checked all PT-10 deliverables against repository artifacts.
2. Executed `./gradlew test jacocoTestReport` to ensure coverage values referenced in docs remain valid.
3. Spot-audited code references in README, API reference, and security summary for drift.
4. Validated troubleshooting steps by reproducing three historical incidents on Tier A/B devices.
5. Confirmed links and file paths resolve locally within the repository.

## Findings
- ✅ README setup steps align with current Gradle configuration and SDK requirements.
- ✅ ADRs capture the final decisions for audio ingest, on-device inference, security layering, and document export.
- ✅ API reference tables match class and package names in source tree.
- ✅ Troubleshooting playbook reproduces outcomes for permission denial, AI throttling, and coverage gate failures.
- ✅ Security summary (`docs/PT5_SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`) remains authoritative and referenced from README and handover checklist.
- ✅ Deployment readiness, handover checklist, and testing documentation remain internally consistent (dates, version numbers, metrics).
- ⚠️ No discrepancies found; next scheduled review is aligned with quarterly maintenance.
