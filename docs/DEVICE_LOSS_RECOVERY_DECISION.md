- **Status**: Approved
- **Review Date**: 2024-04-15

## Executive Summary

This document presents the analysis and decision for the default device-loss recovery path in the Ambient Scribe application. After comprehensive evaluation of two primary approaches - Remote Wipe Token and Server Re-encryption - the decision is to implement **Server Re-encryption as the default path** with Remote Wipe Token as a fallback option.

## Problem Statement

When a device containing sensitive medical data is lost, stolen, or compromised, we need a secure and reliable method to:
1. Prevent unauthorized access to patient data
2. Ensure data recovery for legitimate users
3. Maintain compliance with healthcare regulations (HIPAA, DPDP)
4. Minimize data loss and business continuity impact

## Options Analysis

### Option A: Server Re-encryption (RECOMMENDED)

#### Description
PDFs and sensitive data are uploaded encrypted to the clinic's public key. When device loss occurs, the server re-encrypts all data with a new key pair, rendering the lost device's data inaccessible.

#### Advantages
- **Data Preservation**: No data loss - all information remains accessible
- **Compliance**: Maintains audit trails and data integrity
- **Scalability**: Works for any number of devices and clinics
- **Recovery Speed**: Immediate data access with new credentials
- **Cost Effective**: No additional infrastructure required
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of data access and modifications
- **Clinic Control**: Clinics maintain control over their data encryption

#### Disadvantages
- **Server Dependency**: Requires server infrastructure
- **Network Requirement**: Needs internet connectivity for upload
- **Storage Cost**: Server storage for encrypted data
- **Complexity**: More complex implementation than local-only solutions

#### Implementation Details
```kotlin
// Device Loss Recovery Service - Option A
class DeviceLossRecoveryService {
    suspend fun encryptPdfWithClinicKey(
        pdfPath: String,
        encounterId: String,
        clinicId: String,
        clinicPublicKey: String
    ): Result<RecoveryResult>
    
    suspend fun uploadEncryptedPdf(
        encryptedPdfPath: String,
        encounterId: String,
        clinicId: String,
        serverEndpoint: String
    ): Result<UploadResult>
}
```

#### Security Considerations
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for data encryption
- **Key Management**: RSA-2048/ECC-256 for key exchange
- **Transport Security**: TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with audit logging
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is uploaded

### Option B: Remote Wipe Token (FALLBACK)

#### Description
A secure token is stored on the device that allows remote wiping of all local data. When device loss occurs, the token is activated to securely delete all sensitive data.

#### Advantages
- **Local Control**: No server dependency
- **Immediate Effect**: Instant data destruction
- **Simple Implementation**: Straightforward token-based approach
- **Privacy**: No data leaves the device

#### Disadvantages
- **Data Loss**: Permanent loss of all data on lost device
- **Recovery Complexity**: Difficult to recover data after wipe
- **Token Security**: Risk of token compromise
- **Compliance Issues**: May violate data retention requirements
- **Business Impact**: Loss of valuable medical records
- **Audit Trail**: Limited audit capabilities

#### Implementation Details
```kotlin
// Remote Wipe Token Service - Option B
class RemoteWipeTokenService {
    suspend fun generateWipeToken(deviceId: String): Result<WipeToken>
    suspend fun activateWipeToken(token: String): Result<WipeResult>
    suspend fun verifyWipeCompletion(deviceId: String): Result<WipeStatus>
}
```

## Decision Matrix

| Criteria | Server Re-encryption | Remote Wipe Token | Weight | Winner |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|--------|
| Data Preservation | 9/10 | 2/10 | 25% | Server Re-encryption |
| Compliance | 9/10 | 6/10 | 20% | Server Re-encryption |
| Security | 8/10 | 7/10 | 20% | Server Re-encryption |
| Recovery Speed | 8/10 | 3/10 | 15% | Server Re-encryption |
| Implementation Complexity | 6/10 | 8/10 | 10% | Remote Wipe Token |
| Cost | 7/10 | 9/10 | 5% | Remote Wipe Token |
| Scalability | 9/10 | 5/10 | 5% | Server Re-encryption |

**Total Score**: Server Re-encryption: 8.1/10, Remote Wipe Token: 5.4/10

   - Use for extreme security scenarios
   - Integrate with server re-encryption

### Hybrid Approach

For maximum security and flexibility, implement both approaches:

```kotlin
class HybridDeviceLossRecovery {
    suspend fun handleDeviceLoss(
        deviceId: String,
        clinicId: String,
        recoveryMode: RecoveryMode
    ): Result<RecoveryResult> {
        return when (recoveryMode) {
            RecoveryMode.SERVER_REENCRYPTION -> {
                // Primary: Server re-encryption
                serverReencryptionService.recoverData(deviceId, clinicId)
            }
            RecoveryMode.REMOTE_WIPE -> {
                // Fallback: Remote wipe
                remoteWipeService.wipeDevice(deviceId)
            }
            RecoveryMode.HYBRID -> {
                // Both: Re-encrypt then wipe
                val reencryptResult = serverReencryptionService.recoverData(deviceId, clinicId)
                if (reencryptResult.isSuccess) {
                    remoteWipeService.wipeDevice(deviceId)
                }
                reencryptResult
            }
        }
    }
}
```
